# Project Rules

## Git Rules
- Commit messages should follow the Conventional Commits format
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- Each commit should be focused on a single responsibility
- First commit should be named "first commit" and contain initial project setup

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (spaces preferred over tabs)
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Add a newline at the end of files
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes

## Project Structure
- Keep related files close to each other
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directory and file names
- Maintain a clear and logical directory structure
- Place configuration files in the root directory

## Version Control
- Use .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Lock dependency versions for consistency

## Documentation
- Maintain an up-to-date README.md
- Document complex logic and important decisions
- Include setup instructions in README.md
- Document environment requirements

## Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain existing tests
- Run tests before committing

## Code Review
- Review code before merging
- Address all review comments
- Keep pull requests focused and manageable in size

## Development Environment
- Use .tool-versions for version management
- Document required tools and versions
- Keep development environment setup instructions updated
